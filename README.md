# -CHARACTER-extraction-from-Photo-with-EEG-SIGNALS
An Electroencephalogram (EEG) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) application is used for various purposes in various fields. The accuracy of the EEG signals depends on the feature extraction and classification methods used. Our study includes biLSTM and Welch method as feature extraction and classification algorithms. The EEG signals collected from volunteer participants were used to compare the brain's first impression of a new person with EEG signals from different individuals. The biLSTM network was trained with the EEG signals collected during the first seconds of the encounter. The output from the MATLAB platform, where artificial intelligence training and classification were performed, was exported using a circuit. The results showed that the channels on the left posterior side of the scalp, specifically in the occipital lobe of the brain, were more efficient in collecting signals than other channels.
