Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) applications serve various purposes in different fields. There are certain feature extraction and classification methods used in these applications. In our study, biLSTM and Welch method are included among these methods. It has been observed that the feature extraction and classification algorithms used affect the accuracy value depending on the situations and the large number of classes. By making use of the EEG signals collected from the volunteer participants, the impression formed by the brain about the character of the new person in the first encounter with a new person was compared with the EEG signals received from different individuals, and the training of the biLSTM network was carried out with the signals in the first seconds when the impression was formed in the individual's brain. Classification was made with this trained network. It is aimed to export the output of the MATLAB platform, where the training and classification of artificial intelligence is made, with the help of a circuit. As a result, in our study, it was observed that the channels located on the left posterior side of the scalp, namely in the occipital lobe of the brain, collect signals more efficiently than other channels.
